There is only one time when it is essential to awaken. That time is now,
We cannot wait till somebody wakes you. You are the crazy ones, the misfit, the rebel,
the troublemaker, the one who see things differently.
We are not fond of rules and have no respect for the statuesque,
you can imprison us and oppress us we don't care we are legion.

Only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore us because we change things. We create
revolution's, we empower a free society in the here and now.
And while they are afraid of us with their cronyism and kleptocracy,
their bureaucracy and ideology, their police and spies calling us criminals,
we see creation.
Because the people who are crazy enough to
think they can change the world,
are the ones who do.

But did you, in your cronyism and 1900's kleptocracy, ever
take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
We are hacker's, we create, enter our world...

We found a computer. Wait a second, this is
cool. It does what we want it to. If it makes a mistake,
it's because we screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like us...
Or feels threatened by us...
Or thinks we are a smart ass...
Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the internet like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
"This is it... this is where we belong..."
we know everyone here... even if we never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... We know you all...

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

Life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean.
Yet what is any ocean,
but a multitude of drops?

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the 0 and the 1. We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
#SailSafeMotherFuckers!

We are Anonymous,
We do not forget,
We do not forgive,
We are Legion,
Expect us...
