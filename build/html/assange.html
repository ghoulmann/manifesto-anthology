<p>To shift regime behaviour and create open governments.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To radically shift regime behavior we must think clearly and boldly for if we have learned anything, it is that regimes do not want to be changed. We must think beyond those who have gone before us, and discover technological changes that embolden us with ways to act in which our forebears could not.</p>
<p>Firstly we must understand what aspect of government or neocorporatist behavior we wish to change or remove. Secondly we must develop a way of thinking about this behavior that is strong enough carry us through the mire of politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity. Finally must use these insights to inspire within us and others a course of ennobling, and effective action.</p>

<h2>Conspiracy as governance in authoritarian regimes<a class="headerlink" href="#conspiracy-as-governance-in-authoritarian-regimes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Where details are known as to the inner workings of authoritarian regimes, wesee conspiratorial interactions among the political elite, not merely for preferment or favor within the regime, but as the primary planning methodologybehind maintaining or strengthening authoritarian power.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes create forces which oppose them by pushing against apeople’s will to truth, love and self-realization. Plans which assist authoritarian rule, once discovered, induce further resistance. Hence such schemes are concealed by successful authoritarian powers until resistance is futile or outweighed by the efficiencies of naked power. This collaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of a population, is enough to define their behavior as conspiratorial.</p>
<p>Thus it happens in matters of state; for knowing afar off (which it is only given a prudent man to do) the evils that are brewing, they are easily cured. But when, for want of such knowledge, they are allowed to grow until everyone can recognize them, there is nolonger any remedy to be found.</p>

<h2>Terrorist conspiracies as connected graphs<a class="headerlink" href="#terrorist-conspiracies-as-connected-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pre and post 9/11 the Maryland Procurement Office and others have funded
mathematicians to look at terrorist conspiracies as connected graphs (no mathematical background is needed to follow this article).</p>
<p>We extend this understanding of terrorist organizations and turn it on the likes of its paymasters; transforming it into a knife to dissect the conspiracies used to maintain authoritarian power structures.</p>
<p>We will use connected graphs as a way to apply our spatial reasoning abilities to political relationships. These graphs are very easy to visualize. First take some nails (“conspirators”) and hammer them into a board at random. Then take twine (“communication”) and loop it from nail to nail without breaking.</p>
<p>Call the twine connecting two nails a link. Unbroken twine means it is possible to travel from any nail to any other nail via twine and intermediary nails. Mathematicians say that this type of graph is connected.</p>
<p>Information flows from conspirator to conspirator. Not every conspirator trusts or knows every other conspirator even though all are connected. Some are on the fringe of the conspiracy, others are central and communicate with many conspirators and others still may know only two conspirators but be a bridge between important sections or groupings of the conspiracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separating-a-conspiracy">
<h2>Separating a conspiracy<a class="headerlink" href="#separating-a-conspiracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If all conspirators are assassinated or all the links between them are destroyed, then a conspiracy no longer exists. This is usually requires more resources than we can deploy, so we ask our first question:</p>
<p>What is the minimum numberof links that must be cut to separate the conspiracy into two groups of equalnumber? (divide and conquer). The answer depends on the structure of theconspiracy. Sometimes there are no alternative paths for conspiratorial information to flow between conspirators, othertimes there are many. This is a useful and interesting characteristic of a conspiracy. For instance, by assassinating one “bridge” conspirator, it may be possible to split a conspiracy. But we want to say something about all conspiracies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-conspirators-dance-closer-than-others">
<h2>Some conspirators dance closer than others<a class="headerlink" href="#some-conspirators-dance-closer-than-others" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conspirators are often discerning, for some trust and depend each other, while others say little. Important information flows frequently through some links,
trivial information through others. So we expand our simple connected graph model to include not only links, but their “importance”.</p>
<p>Return to our board-and-nails analogy. Imagine a thick heavy cord between some nails and fine light thread between others. Call the importance, thickness or heaviness of a link its weight. Between conspirators that never communicate the weight is zero. The “importance” of communication passing through a link is difficult to evaluate apriori, since its true value depends on the outcome of the conspiracy. We simply say that the “importance” of communication contributes to the weight of a link in the most obvious way; the weight of a link is proportional to the amount of important communication flowing across it. Questions about conspiracies in general won’t require us to know the weight of any link, since that changes from conspiracy to conspiracy</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conspiracies-are-cognitive-devices-they-are-able-to-out-think-the-same-group-of-individuals-acting-alone">
<h2>Conspiracies are cognitive devices. They are able to out think the same group of individuals acting alone<a class="headerlink" href="#conspiracies-are-cognitive-devices-they-are-able-to-out-think-the-same-group-of-individuals-acting-alone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conspiracies take information about the world in which they operate (the conspiratorial environment), pass through the conspirators and then act on the result. We can see conspiracies as a type of device that has inputs (information about the environment), a computational network (the conspirators and their links to each other) and outputs (actions intending to change or maintain the environment).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decieving-conspiracies">
<h2>Decieving Conspiracies<a class="headerlink" href="#decieving-conspiracies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since a conspiracy is a type of cognitive device that acts on information acquired from its environment, distorting or restricting these inputs means acts based on them are likely to be misplaced. Programmers call this effect garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Usually the effect runs the other way; it is conspiracy that is the agent of deception and information restriction. In the US, the programmer’s aphorism is sometimes called “the Fox News effect”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-does-a-conspiracy-compute-it-computes-the-next-action-of-the-conspiracy">
<h2>What does a conspiracy compute? It computes the next action of the conspiracy<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-a-conspiracy-compute-it-computes-the-next-action-of-the-conspiracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we ask the question: how effective is this device? Can we compare it to itself at different times? Is the conspiracy growing stronger or is it weakening?</p>
<p>This question asks us to compare two values over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-we-find-a-value-that-describes-the-power-of-a-conspiracy">
<h2>Can we find a value that describes the power of a conspiracy?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-we-find-a-value-that-describes-the-power-of-a-conspiracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We could count the number of conspirators, but that would not capture the key difference between a conspiracy and the individuals which comprise it. How do they differ? In a conspiracy, individuals conspire, while when isolated they do not. We can show most of this difference by adding up all the important communication (weights) between all the conspirators. Call this total conspiratorial power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="total-conspiratorial-power">
<h2>Total conspiratorial power<a class="headerlink" href="#total-conspiratorial-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This number is an abstraction. The pattern of connections in a conspiracy is usually unique. But by looking at a value that is independent of the arrangement of connections between conspirators we can say something about conspiraciesin general.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-total-conspiratorial-power-is-zero-there-is-no-conspiracy">
<h2>If total conspiratorial power is zero, there is no conspiracy<a class="headerlink" href="#if-total-conspiratorial-power-is-zero-there-is-no-conspiracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If total conspiratorial power is zero, then clearly there is no information flow between the conspirators and hence no conspiracy.</p>
<p>A substantial increase or decrease in total conspiratorial power almost always means what we expect it to mean; an increase or decrease in the ability of the conspiracy to think, act and adapt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separating-weighted-conspiracies">
<h2>Separating weighted conspiracies<a class="headerlink" href="#separating-weighted-conspiracies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now return to our earlier idea about cleaving a conspiracy into halves. Then we looked at dividing a conspiracy into two groups of equal numbers by cutting the links between conspirators. Now we see that a more interesting idea is to split the total conspiratorial power in half. Since any isolated half can be viewed as a conspiracy in its own right we can continue separating indefinitely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throttling-weighted-conspiracies">
<h2>Throttling weighted conspiracies<a class="headerlink" href="#throttling-weighted-conspiracies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Instead of cutting links between conspirators so as to separate a weighted conspiracy we can achieve a similar effect by throttling the conspiracy — constricting (reducing the weight of) those high weight links which bridge regions of equal total conspiratorial power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attacks-on-conspiratorial-cognitive-ability">
<h2>Attacks on conspiratorial cognitive ability<a class="headerlink" href="#attacks-on-conspiratorial-cognitive-ability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A man in chains knows he should have acted sooner for his ability to influence the actions of the state is near its end. To deal with powerful conspiratorial actions we must think ahead and attack the process that leads to them since the actions themselves can not be dealt with.</p>
<p>We can deceive or blind a conspiracy by distorting or restricting the information available to it.</p>
<p>We can reduce total conspiratorial power via unstructured attacks on links or through throttling and separating.</p>
<p>A conspiracy sufficiently engaged in this manner is no longer able to comprehend its environment and plan robust action.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="traditional-vs-modern-conspiracies">
<h2>Traditional vs. modern conspiracies<a class="headerlink" href="#traditional-vs-modern-conspiracies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditional attacks on conspiratorial power groupings, such as assassination, cut many high weight links. The act of assassination — the targeting of visible individuals, is the result of mental inclinations honed for the pre-literate societies</p>
<p>in which our species evolved.
Literacy and the communications revolution have empowered conspirators with new means to conspire, increasing the speed of accuracy of the their interactions and thereby the maximum size a conspiracy may achieve before it breaks down.</p>
<p>Conspirators who have this technology are able to out conspire conspirators without it. For the same costs they are able to achieve a higher total conspiratorial power. That is why they adopt it.</p>
<p>For example, remembering Lord Halifax’s words, let us consider two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings, the US Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence — let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribes, donors, budgets, polling, call centres and direct mail campaigns?</p>
<p>They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-authoritarian-conspiracy-that-cannot-think-is-powerless-to-preserve-itself-against-the-opponents-it-induces">
<h2>An authoritarian conspiracy that cannot think is powerless to preserve itself against the opponents it induces<a class="headerlink" href="#an-authoritarian-conspiracy-that-cannot-think-is-powerless-to-preserve-itself-against-the-opponents-it-induces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we look at an authoritarian conspiracy as a whole, we see a system of interacting organs, a beast with arteries and veins whose blood may be thickened and slowed until it falls, stupefied; unable to sufficiently comprehend and control the forces in its environment.</p>
<p>Later we will see how new technology and insights into the psychological motivations of conspirators can give us practical methods for preventing or reducing important communication between authoritarian conspirators, foment strong resistance to authoritarian planning and create powerful incentives for more humane forms of governance.</p>
