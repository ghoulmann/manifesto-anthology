Digital Communism, Open Access

Description
------------

In his THE::CYBER.COM/MUNIST:: MANIFESTO, Richard Barbrook champions a cyber-communism against the neo-liberalism. Further, Barbrook explains how ordinary everyday Net users can work against the exchange of commodities with what he calls the circulation of 'work-as-gifts'.

A spectre is haunting the Net: the spectre of communism. Whatever their
professed political beliefs, every user dreams of the digital
transcendence of capitalism. Yet, at the same time, even the most
dedicated leftist can no longer truly believe in communism. The horrors
of totalitarianism have discredited its promises of social emancipation.
Seizing this opportunity, the prophets of American neo-liberalism are
now laying claim to the future. The adoption of information technologies
will lead to the privatisation and deregulation of all economic
activities. The freedoms of the information society will be created by
an elite of entrepreneurs, technocrats and ideologues. Needing to
popularise their prophecies, right-wing gurus emphasise that every
hi-tech professional can compete to join the emerging digital
aristocracy. Above all, they predict that everyone will eventually enjoy
the technological marvels currently only available to the lucky few. In
the late-1990s, the prophets of American neo-liberalism measure our
progress towards utopia through increases in the ownership of digital
artefacts: home computers, Net connections, mobile phones and laptops.
Ironically, this right-wing futurism echoes the preconceptions of
Stalinist communism. In the former Soviet Union, the enlightened
minority was also leading the ignorant masses towards eventual
emancipation. Any suffering caused by the introduction of new
technologies was justified by the promise of future liberation. During
the 1930s, Josef Stalin similarly measured progress towards utopia
through the rising output of modern products: steel, cars, tractors and
machine-tools. Although the Soviet Union has long disappeared, the
ideologues of American neo-liberalism are still inspired by the
Stalinist version of communism.

According to most politicians, executives and pundits, the Net is
founded upon the buying and selling of information. As in other cultural
industries, intellectual labour within cyberspace must be enclosed into
commodities and protected by copyright. However, computer-mediated
communications was never designed for trading information. On the
contrary, the scientists who invented the Net were working within the
academic gift economy. As a consequence, they embedded the free
distribution of information within the technical structures and social
mores of the Net. Over time, the charmed circle of users has slowly
grown from scientists through hobbyists to the general public.
Crucially, each new member doesn't just observe the technical rules of
the system, but also adheres to certain social conventions. Without even
thinking about it, people continually circulate information between each
other for free. By giving away their own personal efforts, Net users
always receive the results of much greater amounts of labour in return
from others. Instead of needing a market, people can now work together
by circulating gifts between each other. Although many on-line
activities are trivial, some collaborations are creating very
sophisticated products, such as the Linux operating system and
interactive music pieces. Despite their power and wealth, the
multi-media multinationals are unable to impose the commodification of
intellectual labour within cyberspace. At the dawn of the new
millennium, Net users are developing a much more efficient and enjoyable
way of working together: cyber-communism.

==================   ========================


In earlier times, the abolition of capitalism was envisaged in
apocalyptic terms: revolutionary uprisings, mass mobilisations and
modernising dictatorships. In contrast, Net users are engaged in the
slow process of superseding capitalism. In this dialectical movement,
hi-tech neo-liberals perfect the existing relations of production by
developing e-commerce: work-as-commodity. Reacting against this
enclosure of cyberspace, left-wing activists celebrate the piracy of
copyright material within the on-line potlatch: waste-as-gift. For those
nostalgic for ideological certainty, there can be no compromise between
these contradictory visions of the Net. Yet, the synthesis of these
dialectical opposites is happening for pragmatic reasons. The low 'cost
of entry' into e-commerce is due to the absence of proprietary barriers
within the Net. The rapid expansion of the hi-tech gift economy is
facilitated by hardware and software sold by large companies. Above all,
Net users always adopt the working methods which are most beneficial to
their own interests. Sometimes, they will engage in e-commerce. On most
occasions, they will prefer to collaborate within the hi-tech gift
economy. Many social activities are already organised by voluntary
labour and with donated resources. Now, with the advent of the Net, this
gift economy is challenging market competition at the cutting-edge of
modernity. Living within a prosperous society, many people are no longer
solely motivated by financial rewards. If they have sufficient time and
money, they will also work to gain the respect of their peers for their
efforts. Within the Net, people are developing the most advanced form of
collective labour: work-as-gift. During the last two hundred years, the
intimate bonds of kinship and friendship have simultaneously inhibited
and underpinned the impersonal relationships needed for market
competition. The modern has always co-existed with the traditional. Now,
within cyberspace, the exchange of commodities is being both intensified
and prevented by the circulation of gifts. The modern must synthesise
with the hyper-modern. Far from needing leadership by a heroic elite,
ordinary people can now successfully construct their own digital future.
In the age of the Net, cyber-communism is a mundane everyday experience.
