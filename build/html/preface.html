<p>A manifesto is a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government. A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or public consensus and/or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is political or artistic in nature, but may present an individual&#8217;s life stance.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally,
a
hacker
is
a
technologist
with
a
penchant
for
computing
and
a
hack
is
a
clever
technical
solution
arrived
at
through
non
-
obvious
means (Levy
1984,
Turkle
2005).</p>
<p>It
is
telling
that
a
hack,
as
defined
by
the
Hacker
Jargon
File, can mean the complete opposite of an ingenious intervention: a clunky, ugly fix,
that nevertheless completes the job at hand.</p>
<p>Among hackers, the term is often worn as a badge of honor. In the popular press, however, the
connotations
of
hacker
are
often
negative,
or
at
minimum
refer
to
illegal
intrusion
of
computer
systems.</p>
<p>These
differences
point
to
the
various
meanings and
histories associated with the
terms
<em>hacker</em>
and
<em>hacking</em>.</p>
<p>Hackers
tend
to
uphold
a
cluster
of
values:
freedom,
privacy,
and
access.</p>
<p>They
adore
computers
and
networks.</p>
<p>They are
trained
in
the
specialized — and economically lucrative — technical arts of programming,
system/network
administration,
and
security.</p>
<p>Some
gain
unauthorized
access
to
technologies (though much hacking is legal).</p>
<p>Foremost, hacking,
in
its
different
incarnations,
embodies
an
aesthetic
where
craftsmanship
and
craftiness
converge; hackers value
playfulness,
pranking
and
cleverness,
and
will
frequently
display
their
wit
through
source
code,
humor,
or
both.</p>
<p>But once
one
confronts
hacking historically and sociologically,
this
shared
plane
melts
into
a
sea
of
differences
that
have, until recently,
been
overlooked
in
the
literature
on
hacking
(Coleman
and
Golub
2008,
Jordan
2008).</p>

<h3>Rethinking the Story of the Hacker Ethic, from Single-Origin to Multiple Origins<a class="headerlink" href="#rethinking-the-story-of-the-hacker-ethic-from-single-origin-to-multiple-origins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The
term
hacker
was
first
used
consistently
in
the
1960s
among
technologists
at
MIT
whose
lives
maniacally
revolved
around
making,
using
and
improving
computer
software — a
preoccupation that
Steven
Levy
dubbed
“a daring symbiosis between man
and
machine” in his
engaging 1984 account
<em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em> (1984: 39).</p>
<p>Levy
unbundled
the
groups’
unstated
ethical
codes
from
their
passionate,
everyday
collective
pursuits
and
conceptualized
them
as “the
hacker
ethic,”
shorthand for a mix
of
aesthetic
and
pragmatic
imperatives that included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>commitment to information freedom,</li>
<li>mistrust of authority,</li>
<li>heightened dedication to meritocracy,</li>
<li>and the firm belief that computers can be the basis for beauty and a better world (1984: 39-46).</li>
</ul>
<p>Levy’s
book
not
only
represented
what
had
been,
at
the
time,
an
esoteric
community but
also
inspired
others
to
identify
with
the
moniker
“hacker”
and
its
ethical
principles.</p>
<p>By
the
1980s,
many
other
technologists
routinely deployed
the
term
<em>hacker,</em>
individuals
enthralled
with
tinkering
and
technical spelunking
but
whose
history
and
politics
were distinct
from those chronicled by Levy.</p>
<p>Sometimes
referred
to
as
the
“hacker underground,”
the story goes that they arose in the 1980s, sullying what had been a pristine and legal tradition. What is often overlooked is
their history: their heirs
are the
phone
phreaks
who
existed at the same time as the
first crop of university hackers
in
the
late
1950s
and
early
1960s.</p>
<p>These phreaks, as they were
eventually known,
tapped
into
the
phone
system
to
make
free
phone
calls,
explored <em>The System,</em> and
found
each
other
on
phone
conferences
also
known
as
party
lines
(Sterling
1992, Rosenbaum 1971, Thomas
2003).</p>
<p>The
end
of
the
analog
phone
network
after the divestiture of “Ma Bell”
heralded
the
end
of
the
golden
age
of
phreaking, which was largely
replaced
with
the
exploration
of
computer
networks.</p>
<p>The marriage
between phreaking
and computer hacking
was
represented
in
the
popular
e-zine
<em>Phrack</em>,
first
published
in
1985
on
Bulletin
Boards
Systems,
where
hackers
of
all
kinds
congregated
(Scott
2005,
Sterling
1992,
Thomas
2002).</p>
<p>Hackers
in this vein
would
continue
to
publish
prolifically
in diverse
genres,
including
manifestos
(most famously “The
Conscience
of
a
Hacker”),
textfiles
(written
in
sparse
ASCII
text
but
often
filled
with
ASCII art,
audaciously
worded
content)
and
zines
(such as <em>Hack-Tic</em> in
the
Netherlands
and
<em>2600</em>
in
the
United
States).</p>
<p>By the
1990s, they
were
routinely
meeting
during
annual
hacker
“cons”
(Coleman
2010).</p>
<p>Although
many
of
these
underground
hackers
engaged
in
technical
exploration,
often scouting for
security
vulnerabilities,
they
also
sought
forbidden
fruit and their
actions
included
mockery,
spectacle,
and
transgression—a
politics
and
ethics
distinct
from
the
university
hackers
of
MIT,
Carnegie
Mellon,
and
Stanford
(although
there
was
plenty
of
pranking
and irreverence
among
these
hackers).</p>
<p>The canonical narrative identifying MIT as hackings’ first homeland — a place where the hacker ethic was born — is complicated when we account for other traditions such as phreaking, which existed independently of university-based hacker communities, and shaped a subversive tradition that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, only to change with the rise of the security industry and new laws criminalizing computer break-ins.</p>
<p>Instead of
locating a
single point of origin
for hacking, we should be attentive to <em>multiple origins, distinct lineages and variable ethics.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-politics-of-naming">
<h3>The Politics of Naming<a class="headerlink" href="#the-politics-of-naming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By the late 1980s, although various instances of hacking existed,
this more subversive
tradition became
the
public face of hacking, cemented, and sometimes distorted
by, media
accounts.
Some
hackers,
concerned
by
the
illicit
actions
of
other
hackers
and
negative,
sensationalist
media
portrayals,
started
to
call those who hacked for illegal or malicious purposes,
“crackers”
(Nissenbaum
2004).</p>
<p>The use of “cracker” was a
linguistic attempt to reclaim and sanitize
“hacker.” Unsurprisingly, many hackers also questioned the term.</p>
<p>As more automation tools became available, many also started to use the derogatory terms “script kiddies” to designate those who use scripts to circumvent computer security or deface websites, rather than finding a unique
compromise. It is a scornful term (no one would elect to self-designate as such) that demarcates boundaries, signals appropriate behavior, and gives voice to the value placed on ingenuity, inventiveness and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>To this day, debate rages among technologists: who deserves the title of “hacker”?</p>
<p>What constitutes its parameters? Some readily accept variability, while others starkly demarcate borders.</p>
<p>When asked, many
are
ready
to
fire
off
definitions.
When
interviewed,
two
hackers distinguished
between
builders — often
found
in
free
and
open-source
communities
whose
lineage
goes
back
to
the
university
communities explored in Levy — and
breakers
with
whom
these hackers
identify.</p>
<p>They
define breakers as follows:</p>
<p>Di: I call
myself
a
hacker,
what
I
mean
is
that
I
apply
creativity
and
technical
knowledge
to
bypassing
defenses.</p>
<p>Da: Yeah I’ve
heard &#8216;obtaining lower level understanding
of a system
to bypass
systems&#8217;</p>
<p>...which
is
a
reasonable
definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="genres-of-hacking">
<h3>Genres of Hacking<a class="headerlink" href="#genres-of-hacking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To
hackers
themselves,
“to
hack”
can
thus
mean
distinct
activities,
from
improving
the
Linux
operating
system
to
finding
vulnerabilities
and “fuzzing” for
exploits.</p>
<p>Some
distinctions
are
subtle,
while
others
are
profound
enough
to
warrant
thinking about hacking in terms of
genres with distinct aesthetics and histories
(Coleman
and
Golub
2008).</p>
<p>Free
and Open-Source hackers — those
that
have
used
legal
means
to
guarantee
perpetual
access
to
source
code — tend
to uphold
political
structures
of
transparency
(Coleman
2012c).</p>
<p>In contrast,
the
hacker
underground
is
more
opaque
in its
social
organization
(Thomas
2003).
These
hackers
have
made
secrecy
and
spectacle
into
a
high
art
form
(Coleman
2012b).</p>
<p>For decades
in Europe,
artistic practice
has been marshaled
for the sake of hackings (
Bazzichelli
2008,
Deseriis and Marano 2008).</p>
<p>Hardware
hacking
has
also
been
part
of
hacking for a long time.</p>
<p>Historically,
its
most
notable
manifestation
was
among
the
Homebrew
hackers
of
the
Bay
Area
who
hacked
one of
the
first
personal
computer
kits,
the
MITS
Altair
8800,
and
helped
fuel
a
nascent
personal
computer
industry.</p>
<p>Today,
hardware
hacking
is
exploding,
buoyed
by
the
spread
of
hack
spaces — physical
workshops
filled
with
tools
and
computers — across
North
America
and
Europe but also in Latin America and China.</p>
<p>Some
hackers
run
vibrant
political
collectives
whose
names, <em>Riseup</em>
and
<em>Mayfirst</em>,
unabashedly
broadcast
their
technical
crusade
to
make
this
world
a
better
one
(Juris
2008,
Milberry
2012).</p>
<p>Other
politically-minded
hackers
have
gravitated
toward
Anonymous — an
umbrella
term
for
a
range
of
distinct and often unconnected
digital
operations —
to
engage
in
hacking
for
the
sake
of
leaking
sensitive
corporate
and
government
information
(Coleman
2012a
),
extending
a
longer
tradition
in
hacktivism
(Taylor
and
Jordan
2004).</p>
<p>Others — for
example, many “infosec”
(information
security)
hackers — are
first
and
foremost
committed
to
security,
and
tend
to
steer
clear
of
defining
their
actions
in
such
overtly
political
terms, even
if
hacking
tends
to
creep
into
political
territory.</p>
<p>Among those in the infosec community there are differences as to whether one should release a security vulnerability (often called full disclosure) or announce its existence without revealing details
(referred to as anti-disclosure).</p>
<p>A smaller, more extreme movement known as anti-sec, is vehemently against any disclosure, claiming that it is their “goal that, through mayhem and the destruction of all exploitative and detrimental communities, companies, and individuals, full disclosure will be abandoned and the security industry will be forced to reform.”</p>
<p>National andregional
differences
also make their mark.
Southern
European
hackers
have
articulated
a
more
leftist,
anarchist
commitment
than
their
northern
European
counterparts.</p>
<p>Recently,
nationalistic
hacking — though
virtually unexplored by
scholars — has
spread (Karatzogianni
2006
is
an
important
exception).
Pakistani
hackers
are
routinely
at
war
with
their
Indian
neighbors.
Chinese
hackers
are
quite
nationalistic
in
their
aims
and
aspirations
(Henderson
2007),
in
contrast
to
those
in
North
America,
Latin
America,
and
Europe,
whose
anti-authoritarian
stance
makes
many — though
certainly not
all — wary
of joining
government
endeavors.</p>
<p>It
would
be
a
mistake
to
treat
different types of hacking
as
cultural
cocoons.</p>
<p>Technical architectures, the language of codes, and protocols bring together different types of hackers and activities. For instance, as it was developed over the last four decades, the Unix Operating System, has worked to bind thousands of hackers together as part of what Chris Kelty calls a “recursive public” (2008).</p>
<p>While
we
can
say
that
hacker
action
and
ethical
principles
share
a
common
core or
general
ethos,
<em>inquiry demonstrates that we can identify variance and even serious points of contention.</em></p>
<p>Given
the
multi-faceted,
rich,
and
often
controversial
political
effects
engendered
by
hackers,
from
the
creation
of
new
licensing
regimes
to
exposing
the
abuses
of
the
surveillance
state
(Himanen
2001,
Söderberg
2008, Wark
2004) and
its historical dynamism,
it <em>is imperative to keep the variations of hacking at the forefront of our inquiries.</em></p>
